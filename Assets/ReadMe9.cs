		//For this part make the camera be able to shake make the boulder follow the path until it reachs the object I marked "Rock End Point"
		//Have smaller rocks falling to the ground and have a shadow under them growing bigger as they get closer to the ground so the player knows where their going to hit.
		//Once the player reaches the end they will push the boulder to the cliff and use a holding jump to get higher.
		//After the holding jump they will climb vines to get the top and push down a rock from the top of the cliff so they can safely land and get back to their camp then they win.
